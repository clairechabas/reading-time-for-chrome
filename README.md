## ⏱📖 Reading Time for Chrome
Here's a very handy Chrome extension that will get you the reading time on any pages you're interested in reading.

<!-- ![Screenhshot to take](./public/tbd "Reading Time Official Page") -->

### Roadmap
🚧 This project is a WIP 🚧

👩‍🔧 Next steps:
- Improve reading time calculator, there are still pages on which it doesn't work well.
- Display reading time in a popup on click on the extension icon in Chrome's tool bar.
- Investigate why some pages manage to block the counter. And:
  - either find a work around,
  - or define a nice error for the user.
- Convert JS to TypeScript
- Write tests using Vitest

### What does Reading Time do exactly?

### Availability
